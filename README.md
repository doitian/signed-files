# signed-files

The files are signed by the following key

[4242 AB6F 6CF6 2268 60D0  B8DA ABE9 D463 8BEF B78D](https://keys.openpgp.org/vks/v1/by-fingerprint/4242AB6F6CF6226860D0B8DAABE9D4638BEFB78D)

You can import the public keys from the keyserver network:

```
gpg --recv-keys ABE9D4638BEFB78D
```

Once you have already imported the public keys, check
the signature of the file, such as `README.md`

```
gpg --verify README.md.asc README.md
```

Note: you should never use a GnuPG version you just downloaded to check the integrity of the source â€” use an existing, trusted GnuPG installation, e.g., the one provided by your distribution.

If the output of the above command is similar to the following, then either you don't have our public keys or the signature was generated by someone else and the file should be treated suspiciously.

```
gpg: Can't check signature: No public key
```

If you instead see:

```
gpg: Good signature from "ian yang <***>"
gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!
gpg:          There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.
Primary key fingerprint: 4242 AB6F 6CF6 2268 60D0  B8DA ABE9 D463 8BEF B78D
```

then you have a copy of our keys and the signatures are valid, but either you have not marked the keys as trusted or the keys are a forgery. In this case, at the very least, you should compare the fingerprints that are shown above.

Ideally, you'll see something like:

```
gpg: Signature made Sat Nov  9 10:51:34 2019 CST
gpg:                using RSA key 4242AB6F6CF6226860D0B8DAABE9D4638BEFB78D
gpg:                issuer "***"
gpg: Good signature from "ian yang <***>" [ultimate]
```
